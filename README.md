# Cameras

This repository is used to store the code to control cameras on-board a Rocksat-X Sub-orbital payload.

Testing github features

[marsha_record](marsha_record) contains an example for how a camera system could be implemented. A more complicated version of this was used for the the 2022 rocksat launch, and a similar version succesfully recorded footage during the 2021 rocksat launch.
